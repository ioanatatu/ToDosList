# ToDosList

My spin on an exercise from a udemy course. A combination of vanilla JS and jQuery manages the following:
1. the adding/ removing of li html elements to the list,
2. toggling the sliding drawer class in css (I wanted to learn how to build a sliding drawer with css and jQuery),
3. passing the name of the list to the sliding drawer title,
4. changing the icon arrow of the sliding drawer and making list invisible,
5. not allowing 1. if nothing has been typed into the input field.

Additionally I also learned how to user git through the command line instead of using the GitHub Desktop.

# What user can do:
1. personalize the name of the to do list by just clicking on it and then clicking away or hitting the enter/ esc key
2. add new to do item to the list
3. delete item by clicking/ tapping on the bin
4. (un)mark an item as done
